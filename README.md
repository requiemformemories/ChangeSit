## Intro
- built with SharpDevelop.
- During high school, I built this in order to make classmates change sits randomly and more effeciently.

## How to use
- The exe file is /bin/Debug/changesit.exe
- edit student.txt and add your students list.
- execute the exe file and load the txt file, then press the button to change sits.
- if student A would like to exchange the sit with student B, they can use "換座位" function to achieve it.
